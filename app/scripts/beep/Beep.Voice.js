	Beep.Voice




	Requires 

	  1  Beep
	  2  Beep.Note

	Description

	  If a Note is merely a mathematical model then Voices are where
	  the rubber meets the road. Voices contain a Note and an oscillator
	  so a Voice is a thing that can actually sing!
	
	  If our Instruments were monophonic then we’d only need one voice
	  that could be re-used to play any Note.
	  But we’re polyphonic -- we can play multiple notes at once!

	  Sending no arguments to a Voice will give you all default params
	  and results in a playable Concert A.

	  The intended use here is to create a Voice, optionally passing it
	  a Note to begin with, and then alter its Note dynamically in a loop.
	  Example: gliding from a Concert A to one octave lower could involve
	  creating a Voice with no Note argument, calling its play() method, 
	  then from within a loop assign the Voice a new progressively lower
	  Note per loop until desired. 

	Example uses

	  voice = new Beep.Voice( 'eb3' )
	  voice.play()
	  voice.pause()

//  Some convenience getters and setters.

//  Q: OMG, why? It’s not like we’re protecting private variables.

//     you can easily do function-chaining and never have to create
//     and set temporary variables, like this:
//
//     voices.push( 
//
// 	       new Beep.Voice( this.note.hertz * 3 / 2, this.audioContext )
// 	       .setOscillatorType( 'triangle' )
// 	       .setGainHigh( 0.3 )
//     )
//
//     As for the getters, it just felt rude to create the setters
//    (thereby leading the expectation that getters would also exist)
//     without actually having getters.
